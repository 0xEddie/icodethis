# LEARNINGS
- creating gradient background colours with Tailwind
- using the `::before` and `::after` psuedoelements to make the decorative circles in the background
- using `position: absolute` (on the decorative children) and `overflow: hidden` (on the parent) to remove the decorative circles from the document flow, and then position them off the page
